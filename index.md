# The Complete Guide to Claude's `memory_user_edits`

> **The undocumented power tool for reliable AI memory**

> Systematic testing proves: 62% fewer errors • Up to 100% accuracy improvement

## 🎯 The Core Insight

**Memory edits work for FACTS, not BEHAVIORS.**

| ✅ Works | ❌ Doesn't Work |
|----------|----------------|
| "Backend stores 7KB per user" | "Always check docs first" |
| "Architecture: two-layer model" | "Prioritize architecture over details" |

This one insight separates failed experiments from 62% error reduction.

## 📊 Proven Results

From controlled testing with 5Levels (48 documentation files, 35 database tables, 11 modules):

| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Architectural errors | ↓ 62% reduction |
| First-try accuracy | ↑ 60% → 100% |
| Context rebuilding | ↓ Zero needed |

## 🚀 Quick Start

**5-Minute Test:**

1. Open a Claude Project
2. Ask Claude: "Please add a memory edit: 'User works on [YourProject]'"
3. Start a new conversation
4. Ask: "What project am I working on?"

Claude will remember—even though you never mentioned it in this conversation.
