# Chapter 3: The Four Commands

## What Is memory_user_edits?

`memory_user_edits` is a system tool that allows direct control over what Claude remembers across all conversations in a project. Think of it as "sticky notes" that persist forever — or until you remove them.

### The Core Idea

| Regular Memory | Memory Edits |
|----------------|--------------|
| Generated by Claude | Written by you (or Claude with permission) |
| Narrative format | Bullet points |
| Holistic summary | Specific facts |
| Updates automatically | Only changes when you edit |
| Can be verbose | Max 200 chars per edit |
| Can drift over time | Stays exact |

### Important Scope

- **Project-scoped:** Memory edits only work in Claude Projects
- **Not available:** In regular conversations outside Projects
- **Persistent:** Edits stay until you manually remove them
- **Separate:** Each Project has its own set of memory edits

---

## The Memory Architecture

When you start a conversation with Claude in a project, two things load:

### 1. Automatic Memory (Long-Form Summary)

```xml
<userMemories>
  "Francesco is building 5Levels, a LinkedIn intelligence platform..."
  "[Automatically generated summary of past conversations]"
  "Uses two-layer architecture with local processing..."
  "Demonstrated strong technical skills and systematic approach..."
</userMemories>
```

### 2. Memory Edits (Your Explicit Instructions)

```
User memory edits:
1. 5Levels Layer 1: Chrome extension on user PC does feed scanning locally
2. 5Levels Layer 2: Hetzner servers only handle AI features
3. Mobile strategy: Dashboard-only viewing, desktop collects
4. Two-layer architecture provides strong anti-piracy
5. Browser extensions don't work on iOS/Android Chrome
```

---

## The Four Commands

### 1. `view` — See Current Memory Edits

- **Command:** `view`
- **Returns:** Numbered list of all memory edits
- **Use:** Check what's currently stored

**Example output:**

```
Memory edits:
1. User works at Anthropic as Senior Engineer
2. Building 5Levels platform with two-layer architecture
3. Prefers TypeScript over JavaScript for production code
4. Uses Claude for strategy, Roo Code for implementation
5. Project deadline: December 2025 launch
```

### 2. `add` — Create New Memory Edit

- **Command:** `add`
- **Parameter:** `control` (max 200 characters)
- **Effect:** Adds new numbered memory edit
- **Limit:** Maximum 30 edits total

**Example:**

```
add control="5Levels uses feed-based scanning to avoid LinkedIn API limits"
// Returns: "Added memory #6: 5Levels uses feed-based scanning..."
```

### 3. `remove` — Delete Memory Edit

- **Command:** `remove`
- **Parameter:** `line_number` (the number from view)
- **Effect:** Permanently deletes that memory edit
- **Warning:** Cannot be undone

**Example:**

```
remove line_number=3
// Returns: "Removed memory #3"
// All subsequent numbers shift down
```

### 4. `replace` — Update Existing Memory

- **Command:** `replace`
- **Parameters:** `line_number`, `replacement` (max 200 chars)
- **Effect:** Updates specific memory edit
- **Use:** When information changes

**Example:**

```
replace line_number=5, replacement="Project deadline: January 2026 launch"
// Returns: "Replaced memory #5: Project deadline: January 2026 launch"
```

## System Constraints

All memory edits operate under these constraints:

| Constraint | Limit |
|------------|-------|
| Maximum edits | 30 |
| Characters per edit | 200 |
| Formatting | Plain text only (no markdown/HTML) |
| Scope | Project-scoped only |
| Logic | No conditionals ("if X then Y") |
| Persistence | Until manually removed |
| Numbering | 1-30 |

---

## Character Count Examples

| Status | Characters | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| ✓ Good | 54 | "Backend uses PostgreSQL 15 with Knex.js query builder" |
| ✓ Good | 147 | "Stitching engine = cross-referencing Sales Navigator data with LinkedIn feed patterns. NOT web scraping. NOT API calls. NOT automation." |
| ✓ At limit | 198 | "Layer 1 (Chrome extension): Scans LinkedIn feed at 5/20/60 min intervals, processes intelligence locally, stores in IndexedDB. Layer 2 (Hetzner API): Handles AI checks, stores final action cards." |
| ✗ Too long | 247 | "Architecture consists of Layer 1 which is the Chrome extension running on user's PC doing feed scanning and intelligence processing locally at zero server cost, and Layer 2 which is Hetzner servers handling AI features like GPT-4 and Claude authenticity checks and storing final suggestions only." |

**Pro Tip:** Use a character counter tool when writing memory edits to stay under 200 characters.

## Quick Start: Try It in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Verify You're in a Project

Memory edits only work in Claude Projects. Check the top of your screen — you should see a project name.

If you're not in a project: Create one first (Projects icon in sidebar).

### Step 2: Add Your First Memory Edit

Ask Claude:

> "Add a memory edit: I am testing memory edits with the 5Levels architecture"

### Step 3: Start a New Conversation

In the same project, start a brand new conversation.

### Step 4: Test the Memory

Ask:

> "What am I testing?"

### Step 5: Check the Result

- **If it works ✓:** Claude should mention "testing memory edits" or "5Levels architecture"
- **If it doesn't work ✗:**
  - Check you're in a Claude Project (not regular chat)
  - Try: "View my memory edits" to verify it was stored
  - See [Chapter 8: Troubleshooting](./08_Troubleshooting.md)

### Step 6: Clean Up

Remove the test edit:

> "Remove memory edit #[number]"
